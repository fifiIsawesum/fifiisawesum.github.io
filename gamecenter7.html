<p class = "big">How to fix Game Center on iOS 7.1.2</p>
<p>1: you need to get all of the Certificates from here: <a href="https://tlsroot.litten.ca">https://tlsroot.litten.ca</a></p>
<p>2: Next you need to install the app called Filza, navigate to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Preferences"</p>
<p>3: look for any folders that have anything EXTERMELY similar to "purplebuddy", "accountsettings", "itunesstored", "storeservices", "iTunesStore" and "gamed" in the name.</p>
<p>4: delete the files or move them after, next go to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Caches" and repeat the same progress, except instead of folders, its .plist files.</p>
<p>5: after doing that please go to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/" and repeat the same progress, it should only be folders and be very careful.</p>
<p>6: after you deleted/moved those files, you need to either reboot or respring, go through the Setup screen like normal.</p>
<p>7: once you get to the Apple ID screen, make sure you sign in correctly since you have the Certificates.</p>
<p>8: for the final result, open game center and see if it loaded, if it did not load then please attempt again.:</p>
