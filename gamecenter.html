<p class = "big">Hello! welcome to my iOS 5.1.1/6.1.3 Game Center fix! if this works then please consider subscribing to my youtube channel at the very bottom!</p>
<p>1: you need to get the Certificates: "DigiCert Global Root CA G2" and "DigiCert Global Root CA G3" from <a href="https://tlsroot.litten.ca">https://tlsroot.litten.ca</a></p>
<p>2: Next you need to install the app called iFile, navigate to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Preferences"</p>
<p>3: look for anything folder that has anything EXTERMELY similar to "purplebuddy", "accountsettings", "itunesstored", "appstore", "gamecenter", "iTunesStore" and "gamed".</p>
<p>4: delete the files or move them after, next go to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Caches" and repeat the same progress, except instead of folders, its .plist files.</p>
<p>5: after you deleted/moved those files, you need to either reboot or respring, go through the Setup screen like normal.</p>
<p>6: once you get to the Apple ID screen, make sure you sign in correctly since you have the Certificates.</p>
<p>7: for the final result, open game center and see if it loaded, if it did not then please attempt again.</p>
