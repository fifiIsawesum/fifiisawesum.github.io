<p>THIS ONLY WORKS ON IOS 5 AND 6!!</p>
<p>Hello! before you start this tutorial, beware that this tutorial may have a small chance on bricking your device if you mess up, or you'll just not login to game center.</p>
<p>1: Before you install the Tweak, you need to get the Certificates: "DigiCert Global Root CA G2" and "DigiCert Global Root CA G3" from https://tlsroot.litten.ca</p>
<p>2: once you installed the Certificates, open Cydia and add the source: "https://repo.thireus.com/" and install the Tweak called "iOS SSL Kill Switch".</p>
<p>3: After installing it, go to the Settings app and see if it is turned on, if it is not then turn it on.</p>
<p>4: Next you need to install the app called iFile, navigate to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Preferences"</p>
<p>5: and look for anything folder that has anything EXTERMELY similar to "purplebuddy", "accounts", "mobilestore", "appstore", "gamecenter", "iTunesStore" and "gamed".</p>
<p>6: delete the files or move them after, next go to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Caches" and repeat the same progress, except instead of folders, its .plist files.</p>
<p>7: after you deleted/moved those files, you need to either reboot or respring, go through the Setup screen like normal.</p>
<p>8: once you get to the Apple ID screen, make sure you sign in correctly since you have the Certificates.</p>
<p>9: im not sure if this is optional but do not sign into iCloud and skip it.</p>
<p>10: for the final result, open game center and see if it loaded, if it did not load then</p>
<p>11: attempt to log in, if you get a Incorrect password prompt then try this whole process again.</p>
<p>12: if you get a Cannot connect to Game Center error, the Tweak you installed at step 2 didn't activate for some reason.</p>
