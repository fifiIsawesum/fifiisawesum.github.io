<p>2: Next you need to install the app called iFile, navigate to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Preferences"</p>
<p>3: look for anything folder that has anything EXTERMELY similar to "purplebuddy", "accountsettings", "itunesstored", "appstore", "gamecenter", "iTunesStore" and "gamed".</p>
<p>4: delete the files or move them after, next go to the directory: "/var/mobile/Library/Caches" and repeat the same progress, except instead of folders, its .plist files.</p>
<p>5: after you deleted/moved those files, you need to either reboot or respring, go through the Setup screen like normal.</p>

<p>9: After installing it, go to the Settings app and see if it is turned on, if it is not then turn it on.</p>
